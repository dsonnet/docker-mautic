Docker Mautic Image
===================

This branch is not used anymore. Please switch to the `main` branch reachable from [here](https://github.com/mautic/docker-mautic/tree/main).

You may need to update your Git remotes (see the doc [here](https://github.com/mautic/docker-mautic/tree/main)).

If you used the default commands when initially cloning this repo, the following will likely suffice:
```
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:mautic/docker-mautic.git
```

If you need help, please read [our contributor handbook](https://contribute.mautic.org/contributing-to-mautic) where you can find us. =)
